Q -> Write a Golang program that performs the different map operations.

Ans -> Map in the Golang is key value pair data type. we can store the values that are associated with certain key. 


       we have done the practical in file '/maps/main.go' . you can reffer to that and explanation is given below :


       1. Creating a map : we created a empty map using "make() " function . key type is string and value type is integer .

       2. Adding elements : we added elements to the map by assigning a value to a key like 'stdGrades["urmal"] = 93'

       3.Accessing the elements : We accessed the elements using for loop.

       4. Accessing particular element : we accessed particular element using key.

       5.Updaring the element : we updated the element value by its key like 'stdGrades["urmal"] = 100'

       6. Deleting the element : we can delete the element like 'delete(stdGrades, "mangesh")'

       7. checking if exist in the map 

       8. checking length of the map using 'len()' function.



    ## For better understanding i have added the snippshots in the snippshots folder
